# owo.computer

owo.computer is my personal website. I made this because I bought the domain owo.computer and didn't put anything on the main page (just subdomains and email addresses) and i didnt wanna seem like a domain squatter or something so i quickly (2 days) put togeather this website. Another motive was that I wanted to become better at CSS. It cant really do much but it looks good (imo).  

Btw... FIREFOX PLEASE JUST IMPLEMENT MODER CSS STANDARDS!
I had to write the CSS for the page basically twice because on Firefox it would look compleatly different than on Chromium based browsers.

## Features

- **CRT Effect**: togglable with the "c" key
- **Live generated crt static noise audio**: toggleble with the "m" key
- **Lofi music** (i tried live generating this too but after researching music theory for a few hours i rememberd this was supposed to be a quick side project and just ended up using the Lofi-Girl Youtube livestream)
- **Terminal emulater**: cuz why not (press "t" to access it or visit https://owo.computer/terminal)
- **3d mode**: cuz why not (press "3" to access it or visit https://owo.computer/3d) website is still fully interactive in 3d mode
- **Responsive design**
